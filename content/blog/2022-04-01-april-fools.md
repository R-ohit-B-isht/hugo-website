After 20 years of GNU Radio, we have decided it is finally time to eliminate the confusion caused by speech to text, and are changing the project name to Canoe Radio!
Canoe Radio will continue to be the leading free & open-source SDR toolkit, and as part of the name change, we are unveiling two
new features that will be included in all future releases of Canoe Radio:

1. Sink blocks will no longer be allowed within Canoe Radio
2. All data types must float

Feel free to join us on [Matrix](https://chat.gnuradio.org) to discuss these new changes, and
we look forward to seeing everyone at our [annual conference](https://events.gnuradio.org/event/18/) in September!
