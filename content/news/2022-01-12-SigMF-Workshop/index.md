The Signal Metadata Format (SigMF) specifies a way to describe sets of recorded digital signal samples with metadata written in JSON. SigMF can be used to describe general information about a collection of samples, the characteristics of the system that generated the samples, features of signals themselves, and the relationship between different recordings.

# SigMF Workshop

SigMF has seen specification improvement, greater adoption, and will likely continue to see growth over the coming year including greater integration into GNU Radio. With the version 1.0 release finally here, there has never been a better time to learn more about what SigMF is, how it can help with RF data/metadata management, and where the specification is going. Join the SigMF development team for a workshop on the future of the core SigMF specification, development tools, and integration with GNU Radio.

Thursday January 13th at Noon Eastern US
